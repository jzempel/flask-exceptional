### Flask-Exceptional

[Exceptional](http://new.exceptional.io) has announced that they are
discontinuing support for their legacy error tracking product in favor
of [Airbrake.io](https://airbrake.io). Effective **November 2014** the
Exceptional error tracking product will be decommissioned.

![Bye-bye Exceptional. Hello Airbrake!](http://cl.ly/image/3l3d1F2O293Z/unnamed.png)

Please transition ASAP to an Airbrake library (i.e.
[Airbrake Python](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-python)).

Cheers,
Jonathan.
